# Positron Bar

## Getting started

This will be streamlined in the near future, but for now:

##### Install the dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

##### ... build the js modules:

```
gulp build
./node_modules/.bin/babel src/main.js -o dist/main.js
```

##### ... and run it:

```
npm start
```
